        <p>First, get yourself set up and in a comfortable space with good lighting.
          If you are able to turn your coffee table or dining room table into a temporary work space I would recommend
          that.
          Place your work mat across the top of your workspace to protect your instrument and table. Place all of the
          tools that you may need to either side of where you’re working.
          You don't want to be reaching over your guitar with any tools and risk potentially dropping one on your
          instrument. If you don't have a neck rest you can use a small pillow or towel rolled up and place it
          underneath your headstock where the nut is.
          Now get comfortable, pour yourself a coffee (or tea), put on some music and let’s get started.</p>



        </h1>
        <h1>Some steps to a basic setup:</h1>
        <p>1. Play your instrument. Plug it in and play. Make mental notes of how the instrument sounds and feels.
          Do either seem odd to you? Keep these notes in the back of your mind while you’re working.
        </p>
        <p>2. Evaluate the Neck and Truss Rod Adjustment. This is perhaps the most important and potentially dangerous
          step in this whole process, so proceed with caution. I would suggest reading more into truss rod adjustments
          if
          you are not familiar (i.e.Guitar Players Repair Guide by Dan Elewine). There are a few ways to evaluate the
          neck. Many seem to think that you can get an accurate read by just sighting the neck alone, however I would
          disagree. It’s good to sight the neck, but it’s more of a quick assessment rather than an accurate
          measurement.
          To sight the neck, simply hold the guitar so that you’re looking down from the headstock along the top edge of
          the bass side where the frets end. Turn the guitar around and sight down the treble side. What you’re looking
          for is an “up-bow”, “back-bow”, humps in the neck (usually where the neck joins the body), and high or loose
          frets that are usually found on older instruments (see drawing diagrams for examples). I usually evaluate the
          neck with a straightedge and feeler gauges, which give an accurate measurement (however, straight edges are
          not
          cheap, come in several sizes, and take practice in getting accurate measurements). For the sake of this
          article,
          we will skip to an easier (and free) solution - making your own straightedge. With your guitar in the upright
          playing position, place your right hand thumb on the low E string directly on the fret where the neck joins
          the
          body (typically frets 15, 17, or 19) and your left hand index finger on fret 1. What you have created here is
          a
          straightedge. Now, stretch your right hand index finger out and tap around frets 5-7 (however far you can
          stretch), making sure that there is some space under the string. A good guideline would be to put a business
          card between the fret and the string as you keep pressure on the fret. If a business card fits snug, then
          you’re
          in the general ballpark. If there is too much of a space, this means there is too much relief in the neck and
          the truss rod needs to be tightened. Too little space means the neck is too straight and the frets are
          touching
          the strings allowing for frets to buzz. We don’t want that. If this is the case, you’ll need to loosen the
          truss
          rod some. It’s very important to always loosen the truss rod before you tighten it and use extreme caution.
          Avoid sudden movements and don't use too much force. If you start to feel the truss rod cease up, STOP!
          Forcing
          a truss rod to tighten will cause the rod to snap and there is no going back from that. If you find yourself
          in
          this scenario simply back off a bit and leave it be. Further steps require deeper knowledge and you don't want
          to snap your truss rod, trust me. There are several different wrenches used for adjusting truss rods and if
          you
          bought your guitar new than it most likely came with the appropriate wrench size. Never adjust a truss rod
          with
          the wrong size wrench, it will end badly.

          3. Adjust Bridge/Saddle Height. After getting the neck to the right measurement, you’ll need to get the string
          height at the bridge in the right place using the string action ruler (from StewMac) to adjust the bridge and
          saddles to the correct measurements. I base my measurements off the string action gauge holding down the
          string
          at the first fret and adjusting each saddle to .060” measuring at the 12th fret. This puts all of your strings
          automatically to the corresponding radius of your guitar, so you don't need to measure with any radius gauges.
          With your neck set to the proper relief and your bridge and saddles at the correct height, play your guitar
          and
          listen for any buzzing sounds. If you don't hear anything, you’re in the clear, but if you do, then further
          adjustments need to be made.</p>
        <p>4. Check the Nut. Normally here is where I would adjust the nut height and file any slots if needed. However,
          this takes a lot of practice and skill to do so effectively, and the tools to get the job done properly are
          not
          cheap. You’ll need nut slotting files of various gauges and they take a bit of practice to get used to. It’s
          good to measure how high or low your slots are but for the sake of this article and the simple fact that most
          people don't have these tools, we will move onto the next step assuming the nut is where it needs to be. How
          you
          can measure the nut is similar to how we check for relief in the neck. Simply put your left hand index finger
          on
          the first fret and your right hand index finger on third fret and tap repeatedly. If there is a lot of space,
          your fret is too high. If there is little to no movement, your slot is too low, allowing for the string to
          touch
          the frets which will cause some buzzing when the string is played open. Further skills would be required if
          your
          nut is not where it needs to be. I plan to go into further detail about this and truss rod adjustments in
          another article, but for now we can move on.</p>
        <p>5. Check electronics. While the instrument is plugged in it’s a good time to check the electronics to make
          sure
          everything is behaving properly. Gently wiggle the guitar cable at the output jack to see if anything cuts
          out.
          Turn the volume and tone pots up and down and listen for any scratching. Move any selector switches back and
          forth and listen for any cracks or pops. If everything is silent, you’re in the clear. If not, make notes of
          what’s happening and address the situation when the strings are off the guitar.</p>
        <p>6. Remove Strings, Tape off Pickups, Polish Frets, and Oil the Fretboard. Next, remove those old strings,
          clean
          the guitar and tape off the pickups covering the pole pieces with painters tape. This will protect the pickups
          from getting damaged with steel wool debris. If you don't have fret guards (see photo no.1), no sweat. You can
          take blue painters tape and tape off the fretboard as shown (see photo no. 2). This will protect any
          scratching
          of the fretboard from the steel wool. Next, grab a small amount of steel wool (half the size of a penny) and
          roll it around until it forms a ball. Take the ball of steel wool and rub it back and forth over each fret and
          watch as the dirt and grime falls away until you see shiny new frets again. After each fret is polished,
          carefully vacuum up any remaining steel wool left on the guitar with a vacuum cleaner using a brush nozzle if
          you have one. Be sure to also get around the neck pickup pole pieces and neck joint as a lot of wool can
          collect
          there. After all of the steel wool is removed, remove any tape from the fretboard and lightly oil the
          fretboard
          with lemon oil on a shop towel and work it into the fretboard. No need to go overboard - a little goes a long
          way. This gets the fretboard wood back to looking healthy and playing smooth. If you have a maple fretboard,
          skip this step as it’s not good to use lemon oil on maple fretboards - dark fretboards only. (Tip: never use
          the
          same towel that you used to polish your guitar. Keep lemon oil and polish separate).</p>

        <p>7. Clean and fix any electronic issues. While the fretboard is moisturizing, now is a good time to check any
          electronic issues that you may have come across. If a jack is loose, tighten it with the correct nut driver.
          If you heard scratchy pots, use just a few drops of contact cleaner into the open cavity and turn the pots as
          it’s going in. This will allow the cleaner to move around and get rid of any dirt and debris on the inside.
          Fixing electronics is a whole other discussion and can get very in-depth, as there are many issues guitar
          electronics can face. Assuming everything is working, we will tackle fixing electronics and common
          troubleshooting another time.</p>
        <p>8. Restring. Now that you have checked the electronics and cleaned the fretboard it’s time to restring your
          guitar. There are many different ways and everyone has their methods but instead of going through every one I
          will just show you what I do on a couple of different styles of tuning machines. I always make sure there are
          several winds around the tuning post. You don’t really need any more than that and if you have less you can
          risk the string not staying in tune, and potentially snap. With string-thru style tuners I make sure that the
          string is sandwiched between one wind on top and two winds on the bottom. This secures the string properly in
          place. With top loaded Fender-style tuners I start with stringing the guitar through the bridge, making sure
          it’s all the way taught, bringing it up past the string posts. I measure about 3 posts beyond the one I am
          striging and cut. This will allow for roughly 3 winds. </p>

        <p>9. Lubricate the Nut And Saddles. Lubricating the nut and saddles will help keep your guitar in tune and
          stable. There are many different products designed to do just that (i.e. Big Bends Nut Sauce), but I have
          learned that using lead from a no.2 pencil does the job just right and most people will have a pencil lying
          around their house. Make sure it’s extra sharp and draw a few even lines in each slot and on the grooves of
          the saddles. This allows the string to vibrate freely without getting snagged on any loose particles in the
          nut slots or saddles, and is especially helpful with guitars that have tremolos. It’s good to loosen the
          strings some to allow yourself to work on the nut and saddles.</p>
        <p>10. Adjust the height of the pickups. After you tune the guitar back to pitch, it’s time to dial in your
          pickups. I could go further in depth as to what the correct measurements should be, but simply put, use your
          ears. I start off by measuring all the pickups with my right hand index finger on the bass and treble sides
          while holding down all of the strings with my left hand, getting them all to an even position adjusting from
          there to my ears liking. A general rule is that the closer the pickup is to the string, the louder it will
          sound. If you’re going for something more dynamic, adjust the pickup further into the body. I tend to like my
          pickups closer to the string at the bass side and further away at the treble side. (Tip: Remember that the
          pickups are magnets so be careful not to hit the pole pieces with your screwdriver; you could potentially
          damage the pickup.)</p>

        <p>11. Intonation. There is often a lot of confusion when it comes to intonation, but it’s really more simple
          than people may realize. Intonation is making sure that the instrument is in tune at the 12th fret octave to
          its designated open string. Many guitar bridges/saddles are different - some have individual saddles allowing
          for each string to intonate and some strings share saddles (i.e. vintage Telecasters) and are oftentimes not
          compensated. First, plug into a strobe tuner. (There is an app by Peterson for your phone, or a regular tuner
          will do just fine). Turn your tone knobs down all the way for a more accurate reading and tune your guitar.
          Start with the lowest string and fret the octave at the 12th fret. The note should be the same, but chances
          are it will either be sharp or flat. If it’s too sharp, simply tighten the adjustment screw a few times
          (bringing the saddle closer to the back of the bridge), re-tune the open string, and check the 12th fret
          again. If it’s too flat, simply loosen the adjustment screw a few turns (bringing the saddle further away from
          the bridge), re-tune, and check the 12th fret again and repeat. If it’s hard making the adjustment, simply
          detune the string so it’s loose and lift the string off of its saddle and then make the proper adjustments.
          The tension often makes it difficult for the adjustment screw to turn, which may cause you to strip out a
          screw. (Note: It’s good to check the height of all the saddles again after making your intonation adjustments
          as sometimes the height of each saddle will move depending on how much you adjusted the intonation screws.)

        <p>12. Play your instrument. Now play your instrument again. How does it feel? How does it sound? Wait…it sounds
          off? You probably left your tone knobs all the way down when you were adjusting the intonation, so turn those
          up and now let’s hear your instrument again. Does it play differently? If all went according to plan you
          should notice a difference in the playability and tone of your instrument. If something still feels off, go
          through each of these steps again and check all the measurements. Sometimes truss rods move even a few minutes
          after adjustment and if you're not making exact measurements with a straightedge and feeler gauges it’s tough
          to know exactly where it is. Your eyes can also play tricks on you so it’s always good to double check your
          work.</p>
