        <p>Guitar Routine for Begginers</p>
        <h1>Why should you make your own guitar routine?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info">
          <p>A practice routine is essential to progressing as a guitar player. You'll learn all of the different skills
            and techniques to accomplish your goals, improving your playing.
            We all know to practice every day and we know that you have to devote a considerable amount of time to
            playing guitar. It's important to remember that everybody finds it hard to learn guitar in the beginning
            whether you have a guitar teacher helping you or you're learning by yourself. </p>
          <p>A good quality practice routine will keep pushing you forward. So it’s worth spending time getting your
            practice routine right.

            If you don’t have much time to practice every day, then it becomes even more important to plan out your
            practice routine.</p>
          <h1>
            What Makes a Good Guitar Practice Routine ?
          </h1>
          <p>A good guitar practice routine will focus on the skills and techniques you need to learn to achieve your
            goals.
            It will push you forward and make sure you work on the things you need to learn.
          </p>
          <h>THE GENERAL IDEA...</h>
          <p>I break practice into 4 main areas, plus a 5th for improvisation if required. Each to be practised for an
            equal amount of time.</p>
          <ul type=".">
            <li>Technique - development of right hand and left-hand strength and dexterity.</li>
            <li>Repertoire - learning songs and pieces.</li>
            <li>Transcribing - using your ears to work out songs and solos.</li>
            <li>Knowledge - new things: techniques, concepts, theory, scales, arpeggios, etc.</li>
            <li>Improvisation - if applicable gets added to the end of the routine.</li>
          </ul>
          <h>GOAL SETTING</h>
          <p> It is also very important that you understand where you want to get to. It can be fun just to play about
            on the guitar, but if you want to make serious progress then it is best to set some short term goals and aim
            for them. Maybe set goals for each area of the routine, maybe set a goal for a years time... and try and
            make the routine help you get there!</p>
          <h>THE 1 HOUR WORKOUT</h>
          <p>Have you heard of the Steve Vai 10 hour workout? Well, this is a slightly more realistic 1 hour workout. I
            plan it as being 6 days a week. If you can do 2 hours then double all the times. If you can do more than
            that you are getting serious and should consult a pro teacher to help guide you, or use your own logic and
            base it on what is presented here for ideas.</p>
          <h>TECHNIQUE (15 MINS)</h>
          <ul type=".">
            <li>5 minutes - Finger Gym</li>
            <li>5 minutes - Spider Exercise</li>
            <li>5 minutes - Scale Picking</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This will give you left-hand strength and independence (Finger Gym), a serious alternate picking workout
            (The Spider) and some coordination work, combined with speed picking (Scale Picking).</p>
            <p>If you are learning more techniques you might consider doing an A/B routine where you do the above exercises on day 1 (A) and 3 new ones on day 2 (B) and alternate them.</p>
            <p>Other possible suggestions for a Technique B routine would be:</p>

            <h>TRANSCRIBING (15 MINS)</h>
            <p>It could make the difference between you sounding ok and great. It will make you listen to yourself better. it will teach you to use your ears. It will teach you licks.</p>
            <p>This is the one area that may be better used in one block of 1 and a half hours. Up to you. It seems a lot of effort to get everything ready for a good transcribing session and then only stay at it for 15 minutes, but that is your call.</p>
            <h>REPERTOIRE (15 MINS)</h>
            <p>This area is an often neglected but very important one. Learning songs. It's no good having great technique and lots of knowledge but not being able to play a song. I recommend getting yourself a book that becomes your repertoire book. 
              Songs that you can play go in the front, songs that you are trying to play go in the back. You then try to work on getting the songs from the back to the front.</p>
              <p>BBQ Songs</p>
              <p>These are the kind of simple songs you might play at a BBQ or party, that you can play after a few beers, for that moment when a guitar ends up in your lap and you have to play for a group of people. If this happens it is better to play a sing-along song and get others involved than just to show off some flashy guitar widdle. </p>
              <p>Solo Songs</p>
              <p>The songs that fit into this category sound good on their own - without the need for accompaniment or vocals.Any nice chord melody arrangement would be great.</p>
              <p>Band Songs</p>
              <p>These are songs that you should learn to play along with the actual track all the way through. Some songs don't sound so good by themselves and need to be played with a band. These songs are for this section. Do make sure that you play them all the way through. Don't leave any bits out - learn the whole thing. Work on each song until you can play along with the track. Be realistic and choose achievable songs, work up to very hard stuff over time.</p>
              <p>Advanced Songs</p>
              <p>Once your skills are better developed and you are keen on learning guitar songs (Joe Pass, Satriani and any other guitar gods) - this area will replace BBQ songs - you should have plenty of them sorted by the time you get to this. If you have not - go back and get some easy songs down NOW!</p>
              <p>Either work one one song in each section for 5 minutes each, or choose a new tune to work on and focus on that for the whole 15 mins.</p>
              <h>KNOWLEDGE (15 MINS)</h>
              <p>This area is the most difficult to plan, for certain it should contain:</p>
              <ul type=".">
                <li>5 minutes - Music Theory</li>
                <li>5 minutes - Scales or chords depending on what you need to work on.</li>
                <li>5 minutes - something else of your choice</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some ideas for that spare section would be:</p>
              <ul type=".">
                <li>Knowing where the notes are</li>
                <li>Understanding Harmonics</li>
                <li>Jazz Harmony</li>
                <li>Blues Licks</li>
              </ul>
              <h>IMPROVISING (AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE)</h>
              <p>Just do it - sometimes work on a specific area - like on blues licks, or incorporating arpeggios - sometimes just letting go and letting it all hang out.</p>
