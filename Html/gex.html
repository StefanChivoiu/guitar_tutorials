        <h1>How to read Tabs</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info">
          <p>First things firts in order to learn how to exercise properly you need to learn how to read tabs.
          </p>
          <p>Tablature (or tab) writing is widely used in string instruments. And it could not be any different, after
            all its reading is quite simple and practical, as we will see below. We will show the guitar tab here,
            because this is the writing used here in the website. The tabs for other string instruments follow the same
            principle.
            The form of writing by tab consists of 6 lines representing the 6 loose strings of the guitar. The order of
            the strings in the tab, from top to bottom, is as follows:</p>
          <img src="../images/Tabs1.png">
          <p>The thickest and lowest string (low E) is at the bottom, while the thinnest and highest string (high E) is
            at the top. The other strings follow the same logic that the instrument presents.

            On top of each string, a number is placed that represents the guitar fret that must be pressed. Please see
            below:</p>
          <img src="../images/tabs2.png">
          <p>In this example, you should press the third fret of the A string with your left hand and play that string
            with your right hand. When other numbers appear in sequence, you must play one note after another. Observe:
          </p>
          <img src="../images/tabs3.png">
          <p>In that case, you should play the 5th fret of the D string, then the 7th fret of the D string, then the 5th
            fret of the G string, and so on. Note: the number zero represents the loose string (without pressing any
            frets), for example:</p>
          <img src="../images/tabs4.png">
          <p>Here, the B string should be played loose. When the numbers appear on top of each other, it means that they
            must be played at the same time. See the example below:</p>
          <img src="../images/tabs5.png">
          <p>In this case, you should press all of these frets on their respective strings and play them at the same
            time. Notice that this is how we represent chords. If a line appears empty at that moment, it should not be
            played.</p>
          <h1>Common techniques and symbologies</h1>
          <h>Hammer-on</h>
          <p>This technique consists of hammering the string in a respective fret with the left hand, without the aid of
            the right hand (the one who plays the note is the left hand only). It can be represented by the letter h
            next to the number that shows the fret to be played, or by a line connecting one note to another:
          </p>
          <img src="../images/Hammer-on.png">
          <br>
          <h>Pull-off</h>
          <p>Consists of sliding the finger of the left hand down on a string that was being pressed, in order to play
            that string without the aid of the right hand. Look at the example below (the notation is identical to the
            hammer-on):</p>
          <img src="../images/Pull-off.png">
          <p>In this case, the finger that was pressing on the 5th fret of the A string should slide downwards
            (vertical) so that the 3rd fret is played. Notice that this finger on the left hand is taking on the
            function that it would be playing on the right hand to play the 5th string when the 3rd fret was being
            pressed.

            A Pull-off can also be represented by the letter p. This technique represents the opposite of the Hammer-on.

            These two techniques are often used together and are called “legato”. For example:</p>
          <img src="../images/rolls.png">
          <br>
          <h>Bend</h>
          <p>Consists of raising or lowering a string with the fingers of your left hand, with the aim of reaching the
            sound of the frets in front of the fret that was pressed. When the Bend reaches the sound of one fret ahead,
            it is called a half Bend. When it reaches the sound of two frets ahead, it’s called a whole step Bend, or
            Full Bend. Higher notes can also be reached. The higher the string is raised, the higher the sound becomes,
            that is, more steps ahead are possible to be reached. Its notation is an arrow that tells you how many steps
            to reach:</p>
          <img src="../images/bend.png">
          <p>In this example, the Bend should be half-step. When you want to lift the string and then return to the
            starting position (reverse bend), the notation is as follows:
          </p>
          <img src="../images/bend-2.png">
          <br>
          <h>Slide</h>
          <p>Consists of sliding the finger of the left hand horizontally, going from one fret to another, sliding the
            finger through the frets of the instrument until reaching the destination. Its notation is a dash:</p>
          <img src="../images/slide.png">
          <p>In this example, you should press/play the 5th fret on the 3rd string and then slide your finger to the 9th
            fret of that string (letting that string sound in this whole process).</p>
          <br>
          <h>Vibrato</h>
          <p>Consists of vibrating the finger after pressing and playing a string and a specific fret. This oscillation
            is achieved by “shaking” your finger, as if you were making many very short bends quickly up and down. Its
            notation is a slight wave after the note to be pressed:

          </p>
          <img src="../images/vibrato-tab.png">
          <br>
          <h>Tapping</h>
          <p>Consists of hammering a string in a certain fret using the right hand instead of the left. It is the same
            technique that we saw for the legatos (Hammer-on and Pull-off), only performed by the right hand instead of
            the left hand. Guitarist Eddie Van Hallen spread this technique in the 1980s. However, there are records of
            this technique being used long before that, even before Van Hallen was born, so he cannot be considered the
            “inventor” of Tapping. The fact is that, after him, this technique ended up being widely disseminated and
            incorporated into the solos of thousands of guitar and bass players.

            Tapping is represented by the letter “T”, indicating which fret and string should be pressed with this
            technique:</p>
          <img src="../images/Tapping.png">
          <p>Generally, tapping is used in conjunction with Hammer-ons and Pull-offs on the left hand, allowing a “walk”
            through the fretboard of the instrument using the legato techniques with both hands, as if playing a piano.
            Therefore, this technique is also known as Two-Hands.</p>

          <h1>Guitar Exercises</h1>
          <h>Guitar exercise 1: Correct left-hand finger position</h>
          <p>The first exercise is pretty straightforward, but rather than playing it up and down mindlessly, I want you
            to ask these questions that will help you identify bad habits in your playing:</p>
          <ul type=".">
            <li>Am I hitting each note with the tip of my finger?</li>
            <li>Are my fingers pressing each note just before the fret – not above it, but neither far from it?</li>
            <li>Is there a small silence between each note? </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../images/Guitar-exercises-1.jpg">
          <br>
          <h>Guitar exercise 2: Right-hand string orientation</h>
          <p>Does your right hand find the strings it wants to hit with ease?

            Practice this exercise on open strings. If it gives you a hard time, you may need to give your guitar
            picking some more attention.</p>
          <img src="../images/Guitar-exercises-2.jpg">
          <br>
          <h>Guitar exercise 3: Two Hand Synchronisation</h>
          <p>In the first exercise in this lesson, your right-hand doesn’t have much to do except for playing
            consecutive downstrokes and upstrokes.

            In the second exercise, the left hand had nothing to do since you were only playing open strings.

            In the next exercise I want you to focus on the synchronization between both hands, using the suggested
            picking pattern, and ask this question:

            Does one of my hands need to catch up with the other?

            If yes, either play this exercise slower so that both hands can play it with ease or spend some more time
            practicing the weaker hand before trying the exercise again. </p>
          <img src="../images/Guitar-exercises-3.jpg">
          <br>
          <h>Guitar exercise 4: Playing on time</h>
          <p>Go through the first three exercises and this time play them with a metronome.

            In each case, you should play the first note one the click and the next note between clicks.

            Lower the tempo of the metronome as much as you need, what matters is that you play each note on time.

            Note: In the exercises above, only one note value is being used, the quaver.</p>
          <br>
          <h>Guitar exercises 5: Chords</h>
          <p>Building a vocabulary of guitar chords is another very important factor in learning the instrument.

            The first chords you need to learn are major chords, minor chords as well as dominant 7th chords, both as
            open chords and as barre chords.

            However, there are many more chords you can learn, and for the purpose of this lesson, I’ll be giving you an
            example using suspended chords. These kinds of chords have a tendency to resolve to a major or minor chord
            and do not sound good on their own.

            After you learn the exercise, ask yourself this question:</p>
          <ul type=".">
            <li>Am I able to change between one chord and another smoothly and on time?</li>
            <li>Do I need to learn more chords to be able to express myself the way I want on the guitar?</li>
          </ul>
